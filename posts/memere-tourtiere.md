My Memere (term for a French Canadian grandmother) always made meat pie ([tourtière](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourti%C3%A8re)) for the holidays. It was one of the most sought after courses by my relatives. Tourtière is a québécois recipe that definitely varies from family to family, and they all use different types of meats, fillings, and preparation methods.

I was lucky enough to learn this recipe while my grandmother was still alive, and I still had to figure out my own path for it. Family recipes are always very touch and go: "just add some cinnamon" vs "add 1 teaspoon" -- and I think I've figured it out in a way that I can replicate consistently year over year.

Over time, family and friends have asked me for Memere's recipe, so I figured it's time to put it on here for the world to see.

## Ingredients

Makes 4

* Dough
  * I use Pre-made pie crusts from [Pillsbury](https://www.publix.com/pd/pillsbury-pie-crusts/RIO-PCI-112875), or Publix equivalent (4 packages)
  * Enough dough for top and bottom crusts for 4 pies.
* 4 cups water (roughly)
* 1 pound hamburger
* 1 pound ground pork
* 3 medium potatoes
* 1.75 tsp Salt
* 1 tsp ground cloves
* 1 tsp ground cinnamon
* 1 large yellow onion

## Instructions
### Round 1

1. Chop onions small
2. Add meat, spices and onions to pot, with just enough water to almost entirely cover ingredients (~4 cups). Cook for 20-25 minutes on high.
	* Water should be salty light-ish brown.
3. While boiling, chop up potatoes to "home fry" size /(1 inch max?)/
4. Once meat is boiled, add potatoes to pot. Cook until potatoes are very soft.
5. Turn off stove, mash heavily, and *cool down*

### Round 2

1. Preheat oven to 425ºF
2. Make pies.
3. Cut top dough to let air escape
4. Place in oven and cook until top is flaky brown. (~35 min for 2 pies)
