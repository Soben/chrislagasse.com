My wife first tried a caipirinha at Disney's Coronado Springs resort when we first got married, and immediately fell in love (with the caipirinha). Naturally, we had to figure out how to make the cocktail at home.

It's now a tradition of ours to make this cocktail for our Dungeons & Dragons nights, which is following the theme _so well_, don't you think?

## What is a Caipirinha?

The [Caipirinha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caipirinha) is Brazil's national cocktail. It's made with Cachaça, a rum-like liquor made with sugarcane, as well as sugar and lime.

It's a very simple recipe of essentially pure liquor, so we sought to "mellow" it out and added seltzer water.

## Ingredients

Makes 2 cocktails

1. Turbinado/Raw Sugar
1. 1 lime
